### Quick Install with Docker (Recommended)

The easiest way to install Followarr is using Docker. We provide installation scripts for both Linux/macOS and Windows:

#### Linux/macOS
```bash
# Download and run the installation script
curl -sSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/d3v1l1989/Followarr/main/install.sh -o install.sh

Invoke-WebRequest -Uri "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/d3v1l1989/Followarr/main/install.ps1" -OutFile "install.ps1"

```

The installation script will:
1. Check if Docker is installed

| `TZ` | Your timezone | No (defaults to `UTC`) |
| `UID` | User ID for Docker | No (defaults to `1000`) |

### Tautulli Webhook Setup

1. In Tautulli Settings â†’ Notification Agents:
2. Add new Webhook agent
3. Configure URL:
   ```
   Docker: http://followarr:3000/webhook/tautulli
   Local:  http://your-server-ip:3000/webhook/tautulli
   ```
4. Enable "Recently Added" notifications

### Docker Network Configuration

**Important**: Make sure Followarr is on the same Docker network as your Tautulli container. If Tautulli is running in Docker, add it to the same network:

```yaml
services:
  tautulli:
    networks:
      - followarr-net

networks:
  followarr-net:
    external: true
```

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues
- If commands don't appear, try removing and re-adding the bot to your server
- If notifications aren't working, check your Discord privacy settings allow DMs from server members
- For webhook testing issues, ensure port 3000 is accessible if testing from outside Docker

### Logs
The bot provides detailed logging for troubleshooting:
```bash
docker-compose logs -f
```
